Have you ever wanted to control an army of the undead, but found that it was more similar to clerical work than 
your dream of world domination? Well, you're in luck! Necronomy of Scale is a project that aims to make managing
your soulless, rotting husks a breeze (hopefully one you are upwind of).

Use the simple GUI to add, remove, and modify units in your army. Choose a target, calculate attack rolls, damage dealt,
and track HP. Outfit your army with weapons, track ammunition, handle special circumstances like advantage and 
disadvantage, all with a few clicks. 

Our first goal is to track the stats of your army, and provide a simple interface for managing their health and attacks. 
Future goals include positioning, movement, and more advanced combat mechanics and situations, but right from the start,
you can expect to handle your turn just as fast as your sword-and-board party member does.

We are just getting started! Check back soon for updates! 
Typically, you can expect a burst of activity over the weekends until the project is more mature. At that point, expect:

- Documentation: User manual and guides for modding
- Regular updates: This project gets used in my tabletop games, so I will be keeping a backlog of features to add.
- Automated builds available for download on Windows machines, possibly Linux as well.
- Fun screenshots, army preload files, and tales from the tabletop!
